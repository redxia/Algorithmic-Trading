Cointegration Mean Reversion Strategy

In this chapter you will find my cointegration strategy based on gold pairs. We barely matched the buy and hold strategy for gold, however, I share this notebook because it provides useful economic insights to why that is. One example, is that the hedge ratio should be time-varying, but in the notebook I used a static ratio making the spread less stationary.

Afterwards, one common way to solve this problem is to apply the Kalman Filter. I applied the Kalman Filter on the treasuries ETFs to show that the ratios and parameters are time varying.
