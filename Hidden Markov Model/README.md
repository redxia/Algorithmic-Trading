# Hidden Markov Model

In this R code, we explore the hidden markov model in predicting regime shifts. The two most common regime shift are recession and normal times. Based on the SP 500, we were able to accurately predict the SP 500 corona virus pandemic crash on February 21, 2020 before the big shot down during the week afterwards. This makes it useful for applying market views.
